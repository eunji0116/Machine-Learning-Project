# Boston-Housing-Prediction

This is the very first project on Machine Learning nanodegree.
The following is what I've learned from this project:
* How to use NumPy to investigate the latent features of a dataset.
* How to analyze various learning performance plots for variance and bias.
* How to determine the best-guess model for predictions from unseen data.
* How to evaluate a model's performance on unseen data using previous data.

I also learned to use Grid Search technique and cross-validation training techniques.
Since this is using the data collected from 1978, it's so out-dated.
It would be really interesting to use current housing prices in Seattle to make predictions.
