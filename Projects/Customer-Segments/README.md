# Customer-Segments

This is the Machine Learning Nanodegree project 
I learned to do the following:
* How to apply preprocessing techniques such as feature scaling and outlier detection.
* How to interpret data points that have been scaled, transformed, or reduced from PCA.
* How to analyze PCA dimensions and construct a new feature space.
* How to optimally cluster a set of data to find hidden patterns in a dataset.
* How to assess information given by cluster data and use it in a meaningful way.

Other than those listed above, I also learned to use visualizations such as heatmap and scatter_matrix to analyzer further.
