# Finding_donors_for_charity
Udacity Project

I learned to do the following from the project:
* How to identify when preprocessing is needed, and how to apply it.
* How to establish a benchmark for a solution to the problem.
* What each of several supervised learning algorithms accomplishes given a specific dataset.
* How to investigate whether a candidate solution model is adequate for the problem.

The following project also taught me how and when to apply which types of supervised learning models.
Analyzing each models to choose the final model was not definitely not easy. 
Using appropriate vizualizations to make an analysis is the key in this case.
